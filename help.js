*How to use Reddgram:*

1. *Format:* 
          *\/subreddit_name  [sort_option]\*

      a. *subreddit_name* can be any of the subreddits in reddit. see /list for the most popular ones.

      b. (optional) *sort_option* can be any of the these /options. 

For eg. \`\/aww top\` (long press to copy) to get top threads of r/aww - a sub dedicated to cute pets.

Note: Default option is *hot*, so /aww will return hottest threads from the past day.

2. /random - random threads from all subreddits

    /all - all hot threads from all subreddits

    /popular - most popular threads from all subreddits.

_💡Tip for mobile users: Touch and hold on any of the above commands to be able to edit and send with a sort option_

Note: "aww top" kind of format is no longer supported due to issues while browsing in groups`;

module.exports = multiMode = `*Multi Mode* is finally here! (beta feature)
      
Now browse multiple threads at a time as opposed to clicking next after every single one.

Just send 

\`/aww new 5\`

(replace aww with any of the subreddits you want to browse, new with any of the options provided in the help page)

Currently this mode has some limitations;
1. Max number of threads that can be fetched at a time is 5 (might change in the future).
2. Next button is broken in Multi Mode. Send the usual commands for it to work as expected (Will be fixed later).
3. This mode only works in PMs, so as to not flood a group with multiple messages (might change in the future).
4. Currently you will have to scroll from bottom to top to be able to browse the fetched threads.

There may be some bugs since this feature is still in beta, please report them over at @reddgramIssues.
`;

module.exports = subscriptions = `You can now subscribe to any of the subreddits to receive regular posts in your PM or in your groups.

All you have to do is -

/sub memes

replace memes with any of your favourite subreddits.

Unsubscribe using -

/unsub memes

You can subscribe to multiple subreddits by repeating the same or by giving \`/sub jokes+memes+gifs\` and you'll receive one message every 2 hours with a post from any of your subscribed subreddits.

You can view your subscriptions any time by sending /subscriptions.`;
