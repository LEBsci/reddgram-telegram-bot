<b>How to use Reddgram:</b>

1. Format: 
subreddit_name  sort_option\  
            (or) 
/subreddit_name  sort_option

You can customize the "sort" option with any of the following(you can view this section any time by sending /options): 

1. _(default)_ *hot* - Hot threads from past day 
2. *top* - Top threads from past day
3. *toph* - Top threads from past hour
4. *topw* - Top threads from past week
5. *topm* - Top threads from past month
6. *topy* - Top threads from past year
7. *all* - Top threads of all time
8. *new* - Latest threads

2. If you want to get top threads of *r/aww* (a sub dedicated to cute pets), Enter: 

              aww top or /aww top

Default option is *hot*, so /aww will return hottest threads from the past day.

3. You can also browse any *random* subreddit or *all* which returns all the hottest threads from all subreddits. To do that, just send /random or /all respectively.

4. Send /list for a list of most popular subreddits.

5. Send /popular for most popular threads from all subreddits.
